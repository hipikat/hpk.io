# Ada's website

Wherein I set up a little website, and learn a bunch of stuff as I go.

## What it's made of

### Inside the box
- [Wagtail](https://wagtail.org) (on [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)) is the web framework
<!-- - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling -->

### The tubes connecting it all
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for all Python project management
- [Just](https://just.systems) as a command runner
- [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org) for DevOps
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) for the database
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for local development
